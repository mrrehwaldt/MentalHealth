# CONTRIBUTING

## Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo (if you haven't already done so)
2. Clone it to your computer
3. When you're ready to work on an issue, be sure you're on the **master** branch. From there,
[create a separate branch](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches)
(e.g. issue_32)
4. Make your changes. If you're unsure of some details while you're making edits, you can
discuss them on the ticket.
5. Commit your changes
6. Push the working branch (e.g. issue_32) to your remote fork and make your pull request
    * Do not merge it with the master branch on your fork. That would result in multiple, or
    unrelated patches being included in a single PR.
7. If any further changes need to be made, comments will be made on the pull request.

It's possible to work on two or more different patches (and therefore multiple branches) at
one time, but it's recommended that beginners only work on one patch at a time.

### Syncing ###
Periodically, especially before starting a new patch, you'll need the sync your
repo with the remote upstream. GitHub has instructions for doing this:

1. [Configuring a remote for a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/)
    * For step 3 on that page, use https://github.com/mrrehwaldt/MentalHealth for the URL.
2. [Syncing a Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
    * On that page, it shows how to merge the **master** branch (steps 4 & 5 of **Syncing a Fork**).
