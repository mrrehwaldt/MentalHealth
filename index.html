Now, prepare yourself for the fourth DLC Pack \u2013 Retribution. Available first on the PlayStation 4 beginning on September 12, with other platforms to follow, Retribution takes players across four new, epic multiplayer maps, and also launches them into the final Infinite Warfare zombies co-op experience titled The Beast from Beyond. The Beast from Beyond, the final chapter of the five-part Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare zombies experience, features the return of Willard Wyler, the enigmatic movie director villain. Wyler has once again trapped the four protagonists inside an all-new horror film, now set in a desolate military station on a distant ice planet. As players begin to discover more and more infected crew members, they\u2019ll need to battle hordes of the undead to uncover the truth and escape Wyler\u2019s films once and for all. The Beast from Beyond also features new weapons, traps and more, in addition to the hallmark Call of Duty action, in a setting that is sure to include pulse-pounding moments. In addition to The Beast from Beyond, Retribution will also include four new multiplayer maps: Carnage \u2013 A post-apocalyptic race track along the California coast, Carnage features long sightlines and environmental hazards including a fire trap players can activate on command to roast their enemies. Heartland \u2013 In Heartland, teams will go head-to-head in a simulation of small town America that is a re-imagining of the classic Call of Duty: Ghosts map, Warhawk. Players can pop into the local ice cream shop for a treat, and then take out enemies down the street with a Black Hole Generator. Altitude \u2013 Set in a high-end, sky high shopping mall located on the edges of the universe, Altitude pushes teams around a chaotic center where quick flank routes are key to victory. Additional features include floating lush waterfalls that border the map. Depot 22 \u2013 Depot 22 is a watering hole at the end of civilization that focuses on mid-ranged encounters waged in a medium-sized, three-lane map. Players can battle in the cantina for close-quarter combat or engage with enemies wall-running off of a moving train. \u201cOur team has had so much fun this year creating content for the Infinite Warfare community,\u201d said Dave Stohl, Studio Head of Infinity Ward. \u201cSo, with Retribution, it\u2019s the culmination of our thrilling zombies storyline, where players will head to a new setting with tons of surprises, and find out what evil force has been pulling the strings all along. For multiplayer fans, we\u2019re delivering four new maps that really showcase combat rig abilities and great gameplay. September 12 can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d For more intel about Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, be sure to visit CallofDuty.com/infinitewarfare and follow @CallofDuty and @InfinityWard on Twitter.","url":"https://community.activision.com/t5/Call-of-Duty/Call-of-Duty-Infinite-Warfare-DLC-Pack-4-Retribution/ba-p/10394703","tags":[],"labels":[],"likes":"0","views":"10912","featured":"false","timestamp":"Sep 5, 2017 9:32:03 AM","images":[{"src":"https://community.activision.com/eikmo72643/attachments/eikmo72643/call-of-duty/1136/1/Beast_main2.jpg"}]},{"title":"Survival Guide: Call of Duty: WWII Private Multiplayer Beta Weekend #2","id":"10380972","blurb":"Need some tips and tricks to help you rank up in the Beta? Our handy field guide will help you earn your stripes.","body":"After the overwhelmingly positive response from the first weekend of the Call of Duty: WWII Private Multiplayer Beta Weekend #1, we\u2019re now heading towards Weekend #2 which promises to be full of new features and surprises. On a livestream with PlayStation yesterday, Michael Condrey and Greg Reisdorf from Sledgehammer Games discussed some of the feedback they received from the community, and how that will be implemented into Weekend 2. The studio is hard at work implementing the feedback in the Weekend 2 experience as they prepare to further test online systems and refine Call of Duty: WWII MP. The Sledgehammer guys also ran through some new game features that they will unlock heading into the Private Multiplayer Beta this weekend, including; a new level cap, a new mode, new scorestreaks, new weapons, new attachments, and new basic trainings to further refine your Divisions customization. In addition, Sledgehammer Games is also introducing a new map, Aachen, to the mix. Aachen Set in a war-torn town in Western Germany, this destroyed environment is made up of heavily-damaged streets and bombed-out apartment buildings. Push down the center street or duck into the tight quarters of buildings, while dodging cross-fire from the opposing lanes. Be on the lookout for Mountain Division soldiers \u2013 the long sight lines of the Main Street can be dangerous without cover fire. From September 1 through September 4, players who have preordered the game at participating retailers can download and join in the fray. And if you already played in Weekend #1, your statistics and level will carry over into Weekend #2. Here are some tips helpful tips to get you to the top of your Division Leaderboards, and to assist you in earning a chest full of medals during the Private Multiplayer Beta. Modes and Maps In the Private Multiplayer Beta, there are five options for game mode playlists. There are the standard Team Deathmatch, Domination and Hardpoint modes, as well as a Mosh Pit playlist that will rotate through all three of those gametypes, and finally War Mode. War Mode is a brand-new narrative-driven mode featured in Call of Duty: WWII where players must use teamwork to defeat the enemy, to assault or defend as either Allied and Axis forces clashing in team-driven missions for key strategic objectives. In the Private Multiplayer Beta, the War Mode map is Operation Breakout, where you fight for control of a war-torn French village west of St. Lo, an important operation in the Allied push onward and out of the beachhead at Normandy. Allied and Axis forces clash for control of a strategic manor to secure a forward operating position. Bridge construction, ammo depot demolition and tank escorts are key strategic tasks in this do or die mission to dominate the enemy. In addition to Operation Breakout, players will rotate through maps set on Pointe du Hoc, Ardennes Forest, Gibraltar, and the newly-revealed map, Aachen. General Tips Know your weapons. Spend some time with each of the weapons in the Beta, and learn which works best for you, or what might work best for each of the different modes. Keep adjusting your loadouts until you find something that suits you, whether that\u2019s Smoke Grenades, different weapon attachments, or the Incendiary Shells for the shotgun. Communication with your team is a key for success, particularly in War Mode, as well as playing towards the objective in every stage. Be sure to fortify your positions on offense to give you an advantage against the attacking team, or break down fortifications when you\u2019re attacking to keep pushing forward. Above all, make strategic decisions. For instance, if you push forward enough as the attacking team, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to hop behind a machine gun mounted on the turret of a tank. This makes you a sitting duck for the enemy, who will easily know someone is in that turret when they hear its distinctive chatter. However, the tradeoff is that it gives you a powerful weapon that can mow down the enemy. So do you go for the firepower? Or do you flank the enemy while they try and stop the tank? Divisions and Weapons When you first load into the game, you will have the opportunity to choose your Division. Now keep in mind that Divisions in the Private Multiplayer Beta are still in development, so the team continues its work, but for now you\u2019ll get an underlying sense of the new feature. There are five Divisions from which to choose, and what you choose will affect your first loadout slot. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll earn more of these as you level up, and you can eventually unlock all five Divisions in the Private Multiplayer Beta by using the unlock tokens you earn. Speaking of Divisions, one suggestion is to use the gun they specialize in, such as the Infantry with Assault Rifles and the Mountain Division with Sniper Rifles. That way, you can take advantage of each Division\u2019s special skills, such as a suppressor attachment to all submachine guns in the Airborne Division. Here is what you can expect from each of the five Divisions, as well as some tips to best utilize them in any game mode: Infantry Division The Infantry Division is where you will find the iconic M1 Garand, as well as the M1941. The M1941, an automatic rife that has a high rate of fire and low recoil, is standard with the Division, and you\u2019ll have to use an unlock token to use the M1, which is an eight round semi-automatic rifle that produces a distinctive \u201cping\u201d sound when a clip is ejected. If you can level up to Rank 14 in the Private Multiplayer Beta, you can use the STG44, another automatic rifle that has high damage, but a slower fire rate than the M1941. Whatever assault rifle you use, you\u2019ll get the Bayonet Charge as your Division\u2019s skill, which gives you a deadly melee option while sprinting that kills your enemy on impact. For the Infantry Division, you\u2019ll be able to earn extra attachments and extra magazines, so be sure to pick out a favorite weapon early to take advantage of all the extra boosts you can add on to it. Airborne Division Do you like to get up close and personal with the enemy? Then join the Airborne Division. At first, you\u2019ll have the choice of the Grease Gun, a balanced weapon that provides good damage with a slower firing rate, and the PPSh-41, a fast firing weapon that you can gain access to with an unlock token. You can also get the Type 100 through leveling up and using an unlock token, and if you use it, it will give the best range in class at the cost of some damage. And if you continue leveling up, you\u2019ll be able to unlock the Waffe 28 as well, which is currently the fastest-firing weapon in the Call of Duty: WWII Beta. This Division\u2019s special skill is a detachable suppressor, which you can put on any submachine gun in the class. A suppressor allows you to stay off the mini-map, which is crucial for flanking enemies who are in tough positions. Know your range with these submachine guns though, especially if they have a suppressor which limits the effectiveness at range even further, and keep it close to ensure quick kills. Armored Division Bigger is better in the Armored Division, and in the Beta you can use three fully automatic light machine guns which have statistical differences that benefit certain playstyles. For example, the MG 15 is perfect for those who want a fast firing gun to make themselves deadly at all ranges, while the Lewis\u2019 high damage and slow fire rate is great for those who thrive on holding down a vantage point. Leveling up the Armored Division in the Private Multiplayer Beta will give you access to immunities towards tactical equipment, as well as decreased damage from explosives and fire. Use this to your advantage against players who love to throw grenades and drop bombs all over the map, especially those fiery Expeditionary Division players who rely on Incendiary Rounds. Mountain Division One shot, one kill. That\u2019s the motto of the Mountain Division, who rely on sharpshooting for kills. They have two main sniper rifles to choose from, and the first is the Karabin, a weapon that is a guaranteed two shot kill from the hip. The other is the unlockable Commonwealth, which is a bolt action sniper that feels familiar to Call of Duty fans. You\u2019ll be able to use the Mountain Division\u2019s Sharpshooter ability with either sniper, giving you a more accurate shot on your opponent by pressing L3 to steady your aim. By leveling up the Mountain Division, you\u2019ll unlock stealthy abilities such as silent movement and invisibility to Recon Aircraft. Use these abilities to get to a vantage point without being detected, and sneak out of the enemy\u2019s sight after you take out a player or two. Expeditionary Division Those who can handle the heat should consider the Expeditionary Division, whose division skill is the Incendiary Rounds. When used, these shells pack a fiery punch and boost your shotgun\u2019s killing ability with damage over time, allowing you to set your enemies ablaze. If you spend enough time leveling up your character to Rank 18 in the Private Multiplayer Beta and use an unlock token, you can pick up the Toggle Action shotgun, which is a fast firing shotgun that can help you take out a ton of enemies in close quarters. Leveling up the Expeditionary Division also gives you more options for equipment, so if you love to chuck grenades down the map, this Division is for you. Basic Training, Secondaries, Grenades, and Scorestreaks Finally, you\u2019ll have the option of a basic training, a secondary, and a choice of grenades to complete your loadout during the Private Multiplayer Beta. Basic Training is like a perk slot, giving your character a specific boost that will aid them in battle. These Basic Trainings range from Forage, which allows you to resupply bullets from killed enemies, to Gunslinger, which allows you to fire weapons while sprinting and diving. You\u2019ll earn more Basic Training choices as you level up and unlock them, so take some time to experiment with each one and figure out what you like the most. For your Secondary, you may be able to use another Primary, or a launcher like the Bazooka or the Panzerschreck, but most of the time, you\u2019ll fall back on the P-08 pistol. This weapon isn\u2019t as powerful as a primary, but can help in a pinch should you run out of ammo. Keep your trigger finger ready, and aim down sights to get the most out of this secondary. Those who hit the level cap of 25 can unlock the 1911 handgun as an additional secondary option, and it should feel very familiar to fans of the Call of Duty franchise. Rounding out your Division will be grenades, which depending on what Division you choose, you\u2019ll have a choice of lethal grenades, tactical grenades, or both. For lethal grenades, you have the standard frag grenade, or you can unlock the N° 74 ST sticky grenade, a weapon that has a slightly smaller blast radius in exchange for a shorter fuse and the ability to stick onto enemies and equipment. There is also the S-MINE, an unlockable trip mine that provides a nasty surprise to any enemy who isn\u2019t aware of where it is placed on the map. As for tactical grenades, you can unlock a smoke grenade that obscures the mini-map for anyone caught inside, or stick with the old reliable concussion grenade that will daze enemies for 2-4 seconds, depending on how close they are to the explosion. No matter what Division you select, you\u2019ll be able to use up to three out of six Scorestreaks in the Private Multiplayer Beta. At first, you\u2019ll have access to the Recon Plane, which is similar to a UAV and will feel familiar to Call of Duty fans, the Glide Bomb, a bomb you can steer towards enemies, and the Artillery Barrage, which puts sustained explosive firepower on a chosen location. Through leveling up and unlock tokens, you can also use Molotov Cocktails, a fire bomb that can restrict an area; the Care Package, which will contain a random Scorestreak in the Beta; a Fighter Pilot, which swoops down in a determined location and allows you to open fire from the gunner seat; and Paratroopers, AI infantry units that can help in the fight against the enemy. If you find yourself facing stiff resistance in the Private Multiplayer Beta, don\u2019t worry! None of your stats, levels, or unlocks will carry over to the full game on November 3. But what you will get on November 3 for participating in the Beta is a sweet in-game helmet that you can use for character customization, a calling card, and an emblem.

During the series, a new map called Flak Tower debuted to the Call of Duty community. This fast-paced map is set in Berlin as the Allied Forces close in on the city, and is a small map that emphasizes control of the middle for lookout towers on the spawns and heavy foot traffic chokepoints. It\u2019s similar in design to a traditional Call of Duty map, and compliments the boots on the ground action with varying degrees of engagements, from tight corners in the tunnels to long-range fights on the map\u2019s outer flanking routes. The team also showed off the brand-new Sky Camera system through the CODCaster. This camera allows casters and competitive Call of Duty observers to look at a game from a birds-eye view, giving a new perspective to viewers on game-winning plays or tide-turning moments. Think of it as a traditional camera in a sports broadcast that can give viewers the full picture of the field while also providing visuals for individual players and the directions they are facing. Commentator Clint \u201cMaven\u201d Evans was joined by Studio Co-Head Michael Condrey and former professional player and current Sledgehammer Games Competitive Systems Designer Ray \u201cRambo\u201d Lussier, on the livestream that provided fans a taste of what the next season of competitive Call of Duty will look like. Competing in the exhibition match were Team CouRage, led by Jack \u201cCouRage\u201d Dunlop, and Team Visca, captained by German Call of Duty personality Visca Barca, with both teams introduced by Phil \u201cMomo\u201d Whitfield. TEAM COURAGE Jack \"CouRage\" Dunlop (Captain) Captain CouRage is one of the main Call of Duty World League casters who recently achieved his dream of casting a CWL Championship Grand Finals. David \"Dqvee\" Davies Dqvee is a newer player who made his mark as a member of the fourth-placed FAB Games eSports from the 2016 CWL Championship. Jordan \"JKap\" Kaplan JKap won back-to-back CWL Championships in 2015 and 2016, and became the first player to reach the Grand Finals in three straight CWL Championship events in 2017. Thomas \"Tommey\" Trewren Tommey is considered an \"iron man\" of Call of Duty esports, competing in every major million-dollar tournament since the first one at Call of Duty: XP 2011. TEAM VISCA Visca Barca Visca Barca has over a million YouTube subscribers and over 90,000 Twitter followers. Dillon \"Attach\" Price A current member of FaZe Clan, Attach helped his team take top-8 in the 2016 CWL Championship and top-6 in the 2017 Championship. Justin \"SiLLY\" Fargo SiLLY is a part of an eUnited team that burst onto the scene during the 2017 season, but is also one of the game\u2019s longest veterans, competing at the 2009 MLG National Championship. Trei \"Zer0\" Morris Trei \"Zer0\" Morris found his home in the Splyce organization this season, proving himself to be one of the best Call of Duty players in the world by becoming CWL Global Pro League Stage 1 MVP. The series began with Capture the Flag set in the Ardennes Forest. Jordan \u201cJKap\u201d Kaplan potted in the first score for Team CouRage within a minute of play, dominating with the Type 100 in the first half. Dillon \u201cAttach\u201d Price answered for Team Visca with a capture of his own, knotting the score up at one going into the second half. In the final five minutes of play, Thomas \u201cTommey\u201d Trewen and JKap helped to put the game on ice with two more captures for Team CouRage, sealing the first game of the series 3-1. Game two took the squads to Hardpoint on Gibraltar, a new map that was teased during the gamescom event and will be available in the Call of Duty: WWII Private Multiplayer Beta. Team CouRage jumped out to a 69-0 run to begin the game, as Tommey went on an eight kill streak and earned his scorestreaks early. That helped his team advance to a massive 126-5 lead by the second rotation, outclassing Team Visca early. Tommey then worked up another killstreak later in the second rotation, this time in the double digits, slicing and dicing his way to 44 kills total by the end of the game. A second win for Team Courage - and an incredible #CODWWII killstreak to boot!https://t.co/aqp9IvlcOO pic.twitter.com/eY83Q3gwuA \u2014 Call of Duty esports (@CODWorldLeague) August 23, 2017 After Team CouRage took Hardpoint Gibraltar 250-155 the series headed to Flak Tower for Capture the Flag. On this map, Team Visca seemed to get their momentum back after Attach ran in with the first score of the game through the SW Lookout Tower, while Trei \u201cZer0\u201d Morris made use of the high ground around his spawn to defend the flag run. However, Team CouRage replied with a score within the final minute of the first half, as JKap avoided the engagement heavy middle of the map to tie the game up at one all going into the second half.

Unfortunately for Team Visca though, the tables turned as they tried to push in for the flag, with Team CouRage putting in two more flags and stopping several runs to win it 3-1. Although the series was technically decided in favor of Team CouRage, the two teams played two more games in the series to give the Call of Duty community some bonus Call of Duty: WWII competitive action. Game four, a Hardpoint on Ardennes Forest, saw Team Visca be the first squad to 100 points, but were shut down by Dave \u201cDqvee\u201d Davies who raked in an ace for Team CouRage. Somehow, professional Call of Duty caster CouRage had the top K/D for his team by the end of the game, going 28-19 and clutching up on the final hill to help his team win 250-231. The 5-0 dream is dead! Team Visca pull back a Hardpoint win 250-245! https://t.co/aqp9IvlcOO #CODWWII pic.twitter.com/KSUfY8ryTy \u2014 Call of Duty esports (@CODWorldLeague) August 23, 2017 Team CouRage had the opportunity to completely sweep Team Visca on Pointe du Hoc Hardpoint, and almost did so behind Dqvee\u2019s 43 kill game. However, a clutch Glide Bomb from Attach helped Justin \u201cSiLLY\u201d Fargo, Zer0 and Visca Barca push into the final hill for a comeback 250-245 victory.

MULTIPLAYER DETAILS Now that you know how you can customize your player experience when the game launches, what will you be playing in the Private Multiplayer Beta? There\u2019s a lot happening in the Private Multiplayer Beta starting this weekend. Let\u2019s dive right in! MAPS Players will experience a variety of iconic WWII locations throughout Europe, including a brand-new map that hasn\u2019t been seen before. Ardennes Forest: Battle through the frigid snow-covered forest of the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge, the brutal final major offensive effort by the German army to punch through the Allied front lines. Engagements are fast and deadly in the dangerous, snow-covered woodland ruins. Stay alert in this medium size map fortified with emplaced MG42 machine guns waiting to annihilate enemy combatants. Gibraltar: Battle through the fortified bastion and steep cliffs of Gibraltar, built as a strategic defense of the Mediterranean Sea and a major refueling and supply station for the Allied forces during WWII. Prepare for multilevel combat engagements and treacherous terrain in one of the most densely fortified and fought over places in Europe. Don\u2019t neglect the lower lane, and use the defense batteries there to pick off flankers. Pointe du Hoc: Fight through a fortified network of German bunker complexes atop the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc, an important strategic target overlooking the beaches of Normandy. Engage in fast-paced, close-quarters combat in the trenches, or flank the enemy in a brutal fight to lock down the nearby farmhouse and bunkers for control of key access routes to the bluff. WAR MODE Additionally, players will be able to take part in Call of Duty: WWII\u2019s War Mode. This is an all-new game mode where players must work as a team to defeat the enemy. Allied and Axis forces clash in team-driven assault and defend missions for key strategic objectives. Fight for control of a war-torn French village west of St. Lo, an important operation in the Allied push onward and out of the beachhead at Normandy. Allied and Axis forces clash for control of a strategic manor to secure a forward operating position. Bridge construction, ammo depot demolition and tank escorts are key strategic tasks in this do or die mission to dominate the enemy. Choose your equipment wisely \u2013 every decision can mean the difference between victory and defeat in this narrative-driven, objective-based multiplayer experience \u2013 a first for Call of Duty. It should be clear by now that this Private Multiplayer Beta is busting at the seams.

You can watch it right here, and catch up on the new details that were revealed.","body":"Direct from gamescom 2017 in Cologne, Germany, Sledgehammer Games gave out more Call of Duty: WWIII intel to fans from around the world who tuned in to the official Call of Duty livestream. Sledgehammer Games Co-Founders and Studio Heads Glen Schofield and Michael Condrey sat down with OJ Borg on Tuesday evening, going into detail about some of the new features in the game. Some of these will be available in the Private Multiplayer Beta, which begins on Friday, August 25, while others will be available when the game launches on November 3. Here are the three major things we learned from the livestream event: Headquarters \u2013 Your Home Base in Call of Duty: WWII First, Michael Condrey allowed the Call of Duty community to take a look at the brand-new Headquarters social space that is set to debut in Call of Duty: WWII. In Headquarters, you can head to a firing range to test out your weapons, as well as visit a training range where you can test out the scorestreaks in the game. You will also be able to challenge friends in a firing range score attack, or have a friendly duel in the trenches to see who has the better individual skill. Headquarters is also a place where you can show off your soldier, whose look will be determined by what division you choose and what customization options you select such as with helmets, uniforms and your loadout. Helmets will be rewarded based on individual achievements or with certain events, such as participating in the Call of Duty: WWII Beta, and can be worn within any division. Call of Duty: WWII Exhibition Match Set For 8/23 On August 23 at 11am Pacific / 8 pm CEST, two teams of four will compete in the first ever Call of Duty: WWII competitive exhibition match in Cologne, Germany during gamescom. For this exhibition, six professional Call of Duty players and two popular Call of Duty personalities will face off in a series of games on Call of Duty: WWII. One of the games in the series will have the two teams compete on a Capture the Flag game set to take place on Flak, a brand-new map that was teased during the live stream. Flak is based around Berlin right before the invasion of the Allies, and is set to be a fast-paced map.

Here\u2019s a guide on how to unlock them, as well as some tips on how to use them once they are in your loadout.","body":"There are two exciting new additions to the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare weapon arsenal today, and we\u2019ve prepared this handy guide full of tips to help you earn them and add them to your Multiplayer loadouts. Right now, you can unlock and use two new weapons that offer their own unique built-in underbarrel launchers. The Raijin-EMX is a submachine gun with burst-fire similar to the R3K, with an added ability to neutralize enemy equipment, while the Atlas is a light machine gun that can help your squad advance on positions and hold down objectives with lethal accuracy. If you have a Season Pass, then these weapons are already unlocked for your convenience. However, if you don\u2019t have a Season Pass, you can still experience these two new weapons if you complete two simple challenges. Here\u2019s how to unlock these new weapons, as well as some tips and tricks on how to use them in your favorite multiplayer game modes. RAIJIN-EMX 3-round burst ballistic firearm. Accurate at longer ranges but can be fired quickly at the expense of accuracy. Comes with a built in EMP launcher that detonates on impact. How to Unlock It: Complete 20 matches where you got at least 10 kills using burst fire weapons. If you need a reminder on what weapons to use in order to unlock this challenge, you must get at least 10 kills using weapons like the R3K, the R-VN, or the Hailstorm. The easiest way to achieve this is to first enter a game mode that gives you a lot of time to rack up your numbers. If you are great at Team Deathmatch, it is certainly an option, but you may have more time to suit your play style in longer game modes like Domination and Hardpoint. Obviously, don\u2019t try to do this challenge in Search and Destroy, or you are going to have a tough time. For burst-fire weapons, accuracy is key, so aim down sights and if they are too obtrusive for your taste, don\u2019t be afraid to spend a create-a-class point on an optical attachment. And be sure to slot the Hailstorm into your Secondary, so you can continue to rack up kills when you need to swap weapons. Loadout Tips Because the Raijin-EMX has an underbarrel grenade launcher that essentially gives you a free EMP tactical grenade, it would not be wise to spend a create-a-class point on a tactical grenade. You could be a jack-of-all trades and give yourself a Drone Shield, a Nano Shot, or Trophy System, or you can use those extra points on more attachments or perks that can help you unlock the true power of this weapon. The Raijin-EMX is a strong candidate for a stealthy loadout, with the EMP grenade launcher making sure that enemies won\u2019t see you coming through equipment or on the HUD. For this option, slap on a suppressor and perks like Ghost, Cold-Blooded and Dead Silence so you can get a jump on any enemy. The EMP grenade launcher also makes the Engineer perk a perfect complement to the Raijin-EMX, as that perk gives you the ability to detect enemy equipment and scorestreaks through walls. If you want to be your teammates\u2019 favorite player, use a launcher like the Spartan SA3 as a secondary to take out all the killstreaks you want, while using the EMP grenades to snuff out any equipment lying around the map. ATLAS Full-auto ballistic weapon. Best in class accuracy and range but has limited ammo capacity. The built in underbarrel fires a tactical Smoke Drone that moves down range while producing visual cover. How to Unlock It: Complete 20 matches where you got at least 10 kills using the Raijin-EMX. Seems simple enough, right? Just like in the challenge for the Raijin-EMX, play games that will give you a lot of time to make your mark. I would also recommend taking a peek at the Raijin-EMX loadout tips above, which could help you build a great weapon that will get you up to 10 kills in game in no time flat. Like any burst-fire weapon, make your shots count with the Raijin-EMX. Because of the accuracy penalty for firing it quickly, be sure to have the best aim possible on your opponent. Atlas Loadout Tips The first tip for the Raijin-EMX still applies to the Atlas: Don\u2019t waste a create-a-class point on a tactical grenade, unless you want to use it for a piece of equipment like the Trophy System. The second is to take advantage of the Atlas\u2019 built in Smoke Drone launcher. Because that will provide a smokescreen that moves downrange, it is a no-brainer to take a Thermal Sight with one of your create-a-class points. Throw a smoke drone down a long hallway, aim through the Thermal sights, and pray nobody has Cold Blooded while you pick off the stragglers caught in the smoke. A small magazine size makes the Atlas the perfect gun to throw Extended Mag on, which will allow you to get in a few more shots before you have to reload. Speaking of reloading, you may want to pick up the Dexterity perk for faster reloads, unless you want to spend a few seconds fiddling with your gun while you are just outside of enemy territory. Although you could experiment with all the rigs on the Raijin-EMX, you may want to focus on the Merc for the Atlas. Because of the decreased mobility that comes with a light-machine gun, the Man-at-Arms trait is a must for those who want to make sure their movement is not compromised while using the Atlas. Plus, the increase to starting ammunition is a definite bonus, especially with the Atlas\u2019 small clip size. So brace yourself with these tips and get cracking on unlocking these two new weapons for Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Your loadout will thank you later.

Check out what Glen Schofield had to say about the game mode and the return to horror for his team. We\u2019ve been waiting to hear about this since the reveal of Call of Duty: WWII. What is Call of Duty: WWII - Nazi Zombies? Glen Schofield: Well, at its heart it is the Sledgehammer Games take on Nazi Zombies. So, you\u2019re going to see a game that has the gameplay that you know, of course, but with some new edges and new things in it. It will feel familiar and fun, but it\u2019s going to be set in a new world, and it\u2019s got an all-new deep, rich story. We spent two and a half years working on the story. How early in the development of Call of Duty: WWII did the team decide to put a zombies mode in the game? We\u2019ve been wanting to do our own zombies for a long time. Exo Zombies was developed in partnership with Raven Software and they did a great job. We wanted to put our spin on zombies. We had the idea for the story early, with all the research that went into the rest of the game. With Call of Duty going back to its roots, does that give you a blank canvas to work with as far as zombies is concerned? It\u2019s a blank canvas because we get to set down our own rules. We wanted to go real serious with this, and it\u2019s our return to creating a horror-based experience. Because of your pedigree in the horror genre, what can we expect with Nazi Zombies? The core gameplay is, at its heart, what makes this whole thing really fun. So, we didn\u2019t change the core gameplay. We made some additions to it, but what sets this apart and makes it unique is the horror story. The background and all the reasons you are fighting these zombies in the first place. But make no mistake that making something scarier, the pace changes. There are some places where we\u2019re going to slow down, or you\u2019re going to stop. You\u2019re going to worry. Am I going to get scared? That changes from playing with one all the way up to four players. At its heart, we\u2019ve made it as scary as possible. What types of scares can people expect in Nazi Zombies? Scary doesn\u2019t always mean like, \u2018Ah!\u2019 It can mean real tension. Which is, again, if you\u2019re a horror fan, that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, those different types of adrenaline rushes. Is Nazi Zombies going to have its own spooky score that we can listen to? We are going down to the same recording studio we used for the main score and we\u2019ll be doing a few days worth of zombie stuff, \u2018Grr, grr, grr,\u2019 and, \u2018Boom, boom, boom.\u2019 Just have them go off. Going down there and just watching those musicians do it for the first few days, the passion that I saw with those guys and how good they are, what a difference it makes and I can\u2019t wait to get it into the game. Can you tell us more about the zombies we\u2019ll be facing? Doktor Straub, the game\u2019s primary villain, was given orders to take dead soldiers and create an invincible army that could be easily replenished. The Doktor starts to say, \u2018Why do I need a hand when a claw is better?\u2019 Or, \u2018I\u2019ll put a saw blade on instead.\u2019 So, you\u2019re going to see some experiments. That actually sounds pretty terrifying. We\u2019re very proud of it, and we\u2019re really excited about. Tell us about the characters who will be battling Doktor Straub and his undead creations. Our characters have been sent in to find and recover the loot that was stolen by the German Army, mainly the art. They are thrust into this storyline, and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to them. Where do the new weapons and tech come from in the game? The place where Doktor Straub works, It\u2019s a German military laboratory that\u2019s split between scientific and medical studies. They had to fashion all these pieces of equipment to keep the zombie body parts together, so they\u2019re good at making stuff like that. So, you\u2019re going to see some weapons that have to do with some of the technology that they have there and some pretty brutal ones, as well. There is a talented team of artists at Sledgehammer Games working on Call of Duty: WWII, but how does your background as an artist lend itself towards your career as a game developer? For me, it\u2019s everything because it\u2019s not only my background. My background in art is also in the techniques of art: painting, drawing, all that stuff, that\u2019s what I do. Art, in itself starts with the idea, that\u2019s what I learned from a very early age. Before you start anything on a piece of canvas, you start with an idea. Art told me to go after ideas first. I make probably 300 drawings a year, so I\u2019m looking at faces all the time, I\u2019m looking at structures. It helps me with gameplay because I can picture it. When I was concepting the exo-suit in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, my first instinct was, \u2018I want to jump really high.\u2019 Then I started thinking, \u2018Well, what would that look like?\u2019 I also remember reading an article on exo-skeletons and that sort of tech, so I had a basis to begin sketching and seeing where it would go. How does it feel to finally be able to talk about Nazi Zombies? Well, I mean, just like the rest of the game, it\u2019s a giant relief when you\u2019re first able to talk about the game. As we get closer and closer to shipping, it just feels like this special little thing we made here and it\u2019s now it\u2019s not little anymore. I\u2019m still very anxious for it to come out. I can\u2019t wait. And I can\u2019t wait to show more Look for more information about Call of Duty: WWII including Nazi Zombies in the future as we get closer to the launch of the game!

Read on for our preview and interview!","body":"If you stare into the distance, you can just make out Destiny 2 starting to hit the horizon. It\u2019s not long now until the highly-anticipated game debuts on September 6, and we recently spent time playing the game and exploring some of the many locations there are to visit as you fight to regain your Light and defend humanity along with your fellow Guardians. What stands out immediately is that there are a lot of things to do in Destiny 2. From Public Events to Adventures and Lost Sectors, you\u2019ll find multiple paths open before you as you continue your career as a Guardian, or if you\u2019re taking up the mantle of defender for the first time. And that\u2019s all in addition to the campaign, which features a truly compelling storyline with one of the best antagonists I\u2019ve ever experienced in Dominus Ghaul, leader of the Red Cabal who wants to take the Light for himself. During a recent preview event hosted by Bungie in Seattle, I spent much of my time exploring the European Dead Zone, just one of the many locales available in Destiny 2. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll check in with a sniper named Devrim Kay holed up in the tower of a church that has seen better days, yet still feels like a place of reverence and importance. From Kay\u2019s vantage point, I could see a Public Event raging down below, while I received information from him. From there, it was off to points unknown as a followed the campaign path, yet I kept putting that on hold to take part in other adventures, because Destiny 2 does a fantastic job of putting a wealth of choices in front of you. Never once did I feel a nagging feeling to get back to the campaign, because everything else you can do taps in to more of the game\u2019s rich story. There is a ton of stuff in here for you to enjoy, both on your own and with other Guardians, and personally I can\u2019t wait to jump back in. Oh, Cayde-6 was right, there actually is a ton of loot. At gamescom, we spoke to Bungie Project Lead Mark Noseworthy about the story and the EDZ, and here\u2019s a deeper look into Destiny 2. Mark, what does a Project Lead do? Mark Noseworthy: The Project Lead\u2019s job is to manage the leadership team, that includes the executive producer, and is ultimately responsible for the game getting done on time, on budget, to meet our expectations and to have a team that\u2019s willing and able to do it again. What has the character process been like for Destiny 2? There are some very rich characters here, and Ghaul is definitely a standout. You know, we wanted to tell the story with relatable themes. The primary role of the story in a video game is, we think, to give you context in the universe and to make the game make sense. One of the ways we do that is by having a clear plot and interesting characters, but it\u2019s also making something you can relate to. With Ghaul we wanted a villain that wasn\u2019t this mustache twirling cartoon character, but someone with some depth to him, someone who you could actually sympathize with. There are great villains in pop culture, characters that are really sympathetic. You can understand maybe why they\u2019re bad, or what their motives are. You don\u2019t agree with them, but you understand good guys doing bad things for these reasons. If I were him and I\u2019d gone through the things that he had gone through, maybe I\u2019d be the same as him. We wanted Ghaul to be like that and that\u2019s why you get some exposure to him through his relationship with the Consul and you get to understand why he is here, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s jealous of the Traveler having chosen humanity. To bless the Guardians with these gifts and yet he\u2019s had this pretty rough life, starting at the bottom and he\u2019s worked his way to the top and earned everything and won every award, battle champion that he could and now there\u2019s this one thing that eludes him that he wants. And he wants to take that, and, you know\u2026 I don\u2019t want to spoil the story. There is a lot to do in this game. What went in to adding so many things for Guardians to take part in? Yeah, you know the metaphor I\u2019ve been thinking like this: the campaign is what we call the Red War, that\u2019s like the tree trunk. That\u2019s the base upon which this story in Destiny 2 is being told. It\u2019s the thing that makes it relatable, it\u2019s the hook that is going to bring people in. But the optional content that you can do and the destinations, the exploration in the form of Adventures, or the things you can scan with the Ghost, or the quests you can go on, or the NPCs that are there. All those things are filling out the branches and the leaves of that tree trunk, and they tell their own little stories. Every Adventure is a 10 or 15 minute mission that is separate from the Red War, but it tells a story that\u2019s about the place you\u2019re in, and the combatants that you\u2019re fighting there. If you think of a destination like Nessus, that\u2019s the destination that\u2019s been terraformed by the Vex. It\u2019s got a colonial ship that was crashed, this giant ship spread out over the course of nearly half of the location. And when you play there and eventually if you play there long enough, you\u2019re going to have these Adventures, and if you scan enough of the things you come across, you\u2019re going to learn the story. What was this ship? What happened to it? Why is it here? What is its relevance? What is the meaning of the Vex? Why are they terraforming this unstable planetoid? Those things are separate from the Red War completely but they are interesting stories on their own. They flesh out the tapestry of the game. Speaking of the tapestry of the game, what was the thought process for the European Dead Zone and coming up with this new massive unexplored new area for Guardians? One of the things so far that we\u2019ve done with Destiny 2 is that we\u2019ve wanted not just the story to be relatable but the places as well. So that\u2019s one of the reasons we stuck to our solar system as the basis for our storytelling. That\u2019s not to say we\u2019ll never go beyond our solar system, but there\u2019s something very relatable about Earth and the Moon and the Sun and these things that people know about them. You can imagine something like, what if Venus had been terraformed? What would that be like? It made sense in Destiny 2 for one of the core locations, a place you\u2019re going to spend a significant amount of time with, to be on Earth. And the EDZ, the idea of this spooky corrupted forest with a shard of the Traveler in the distance, the mysteries that are there. Plus, a spooky forest is just interesting, you know. It\u2019s a motif used in genre stuff all the time. We wanted to set a location on planet Earth because it helps people relate to it. There\u2019s a church in Destiny 2 now, it\u2019s one of the first things you see in the EDZ and it\u2019s pretty striking. It\u2019s a beautiful church, but it also, this feels like a real place. There\u2019s a guy up in that church, I\u2019m going to go see him, and he\u2019s always going to be there. Having that makes even the combat and the battles and public events happening around that church, make the place feel very real. That for me is a moment in Destiny 2 where I felt like, wow, we\u2019re really nailing the feeling of these being real places much more than Destiny 1. And some of that has to do with the EDZ, and how relatable it is. The Farm is the new social place for Destiny 2, since the Tower has been destroyed. How did you want the Farm to be different from the Tower? The Farm is a place where humanity is just starting to rebuild, and so didn\u2019t want it to feel like a place that was technologically advanced. But at the same time, you want it to feel welcoming, a little hopeful. Like a place where people could be rebuilding, but they\u2019re not starting to build skyscrapers in here. You can hear some of the NPCs there and the trauma that they\u2019ve been through. It\u2019s really like humanity have been metaphorically knocked back to the 17th century. It is sort of nestled just on the precipice of the European Dead Zone, and you see this Shard in the distance that plays an important role in the story. It sort of foreshadows your player\u2019s journey of recovery. Some players may be entering the world of Destiny through Destiny 2 for the very first time. What would you say to them? The good news is that they need no preparation, because we have built Destiny 2 on the assumption that everyone playing knows nothing about Destiny 1. On a story level, on a mechanical level, we tried to make this a fresh start, an even playing field for all players. And there will be veteran players who come into Destiny 2 who will bring in their old characters, and they\u2019ll all be at level one. They\u2019re all in the same spot. And because we knew we were going to be moving to the PC with potentially millions of new people to the franchise, we had to design the scenario for the game, the mechanics, the story, assuming you knew nothing about Destiny. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve dumbed the game down or made it less complex. There\u2019s a very rich set of systems that work together in Destiny, but we\u2019ve tried to introduce them in a way that people can understand them and over time have that complexity close to them. So, what I would really say to newcomers is that they haven\u2019t missed out on anything that they need to understand, and we\u2019re going to introduce the myth of the universe before they even play so they can catch up on the simple plot beats of what\u2019s taken place before.

Just like Guardians go wherever they are needed, so also does Luke Smith appear when summoned by masses of fandom. At least, that\u2019s how the legend goes. Bungie\u2019s Destiny 2 Game Director Luke Smith and members of the story and cinematics teams appeared on a panel at San Diego Comic-Con to talk about the story being created for the game. Joining Luke on the panel were Design Lead Gavin Irby, Narrative Design Lead Guillaume Colomb, Senior Narrative Lead Jason Harris, Cinematic Lead Matthew Ward, and actor Lance Reddick, the voice of Commander Zavala. While Luke is no stranger to speaking in front of audiences, he started this panel off by saying, \u201cI was thinking about how tired I would be of hearing me talk by now, so I wanted to bring a bunch of friends with me this time to talk about the story in Destiny 2.\u201d Luke asked each panel member how they found their way into working to video games, but Gavin Irby began his career in game development at a much younger age. \u201cI found this box of books that my mom kept, and it was full of these RPG booklets I had made when I was ten. They were RPGs based on cats and rats\u2026 it wasn\u2019t until my 20s when I was working on game mods that I realized I wanted to do this as a job.\u201c Luke replied, \u201cI think when I was ten I was still eating Play-Doh.\u201d He went on to point out that \u201cDestiny 2 is a story about loss and recovery. We knew we wanted to go to a bunch of different planets. And we wanted to construct a different kind of villain in Ghaul.\u201d Gavin went into more detail about Ghaul, who is shaping up to be one of the most conflicted villains in gaming history. \u201cFor me it started with a passionate idea we had that we would create a villain that the players had a personal relationship with. We wanted Ghaul to have a reason to hate the Guardians and to hate the player as well. That meant we had to introduce the player to Ghaul very early.\u201d Guillaume expanded, \u201cWe wanted to talk about not just a bad guy who was evil, we wanted to talk about recovery as well. We wanted to talk about what people in this world care about, which is why we wanted to focus on the Light.\u201d Luke stressed that the player and Ghaul are on the different sides of a conflict. \u201cGhaul takes the Light from the player, but it is something that he is interested in too. We didn\u2019t want to just create a kind of mustache-twirling villain.\u201d Instead, the team focused on creating a character who had a deeper, personal reason for playing the antagonist. Guillaume added, \u201cWe knew we wanted to talk about the Light and why someone would want it. We realized that the Light was given by the Traveler, who is more or less a god, which is a sort of a validation that you are worthy. Ghaul doesn\u2019t have that validation from the Traveler, and that\u2019s what he wants. It was a difficult journey for us to get there story-wise, and it took many hours to realize that.\u201d \u201cThe Traveler has immense god-like power, and it chose mankind to give that to,\u201d Gavin explained. \u201cI imagine that Ghaul must be extremely angry about that. He must think there is some huge injustice in the world, or he thinks that the Traveler made a mistake. Or does humanity somehow hold sway over the Traveler? Ghaul sees this as a noble quest to free the Traveler.\u201d Guillaume said, \u201cGhaul thinks he is doing the right thing. He thinks he is there to save the Traveler.\u201d That became such a large part of Ghaul\u2019s storyline, that it changed his visual design. Luke pointed out that \u201cOnce we realized what his motivation is, we had to go back and change his look entirely.\u201d To which Gavin added \u201cThe thing that really spoke to me was when Ghaul\u2019s Guardian armor began to take shape. His armor looks much more like a Guardian\u2019s now.\u201d Luke chimed in \u201cHe\u2019s like a Super-Titan. He just doesn\u2019t have enough cloth to be a Warlock.\u201d At this point Jason Harris and Matthew Ward joined the panel, telling us their own stories of entering the world of video games through studying and working in theater (Jason) and from the world of Hollywood and film (Matthew). They talked about the cinematics in the game, which Jason calls \u201cLighthouse Moments\u201d in the game. \u201cWe use these to shine a light on our characters to illuminate important moments.\u201d Jason added, \u201cWe use them to be able to spend more time with the Vanguard, and to show things down and focus on the story.\u201d The team built the campaign around the idea that the struggles of not being chosen, for Ghaul, and the struggle with losing the Light for the main characters. Matthew added, \u201cThis is the biggest low that Ghaul has ever suffered, losing the Traveler\u201d to which Jason pointed out, \u201cAnd we were able to influence the campaign and the missions themselves\u201d through what they were doing with the cinematics. Gavin added that the main story is about how the characters deal with losing the Light, and also what it means to be chosen, both for them and for Ghaul. \u201cThey had a relationship that they took for granted, and we called that into question.\u201d The final member of the panel to come onstage was Lance Reddick, the actor who provides the iconic voice of Commander Zavala. Everyone on the panel heaped praise on Lance and how easy he is to work with. Reddick himself called the story of Destiny 2 \u201cShakespearean,\u201d which is high praise indeed given his acting background. It is very clear that Lance enjoys working on the project, having portrayed Zavala for many years now, and he plays the game regularly as well. In fact, the biggest bombshell of the panel may have been the revelation that Lance himself actually plays a Warlock. But he does bounce back and forth between a Warlock and a Titan. \u201cSorry, Hunters,\u201d he said to the playful gasps of the audience.

While we were stoked to see the towering Big Show interview Bungie\u2019s Pete Parsons about Destiny 2 at E3, we were even more excited when he stopped by the Activision booth to play the game with his crew. Big Show is a massive (literally and figuratively) Destiny fan, and when he\u2019s not in the ring choke-slamming foes you can find him running Weeklies, Dailies, Raids, or casually playing Destiny on the WWE\u2019s Up Up Down Down gaming show. We grabbed a few moments with him before he took the controller and played Destiny 2, and here\u2019s what he had to say. Thanks for taking the time, it\u2019s great to see you here. Thanks a lot, I really appreciate the opportunity to get up close and personal with fellow Guardians. As we\u2019ve seen in the latest Destiny 2 trailer Our Darkest Hour, Ghaul is a pretty big guy. If you got into the ring with him, who would win? Well, if you consider my WWE record (sigh) and this being a big match, more than likely I\u2019d end up putting Ghaul over and making him look good, really good. With that said, once we meet in Destiny 2 me and my clan are going to end up taking his butt to task. I heard that you plan on maining a Titan when Destiny 2 comes out, and you run a Hunter right now? Yeah, I prefer to main a Hunter because, well out of all the characters, and this is all opinion-based, but the Hunter has a lot less advantages than the other two classes. Warlocks with their animation supers (Nova Bombs), crazy op roaming Stormcaller, cross map melee slap and oh yeah\u2026 they get a second chance life, it\u2019s like a 4th grade \u201cdo-over mode\u201d. Titans are just, I think, over blessed with insane gear, double everything, Pulse Grenades that last forever they too have an animation super (le fist of panic) and then they do the ol\u2019 hammer gimmick. It\u2019s like having 6 golden guns shots by the time they chunk \u2018em all. Running a Hunter well takes a high level of commitment. You\u2019ve got to be dedicated to the craft and know precisely what you\u2019re doing. Let\u2019s start with it being the only class without animation super. What\u2019s left of its melee, a giant knife to your face, has been nerfed to an \u201calmost but not quite\u201d kill and blink strike is very temperamental. This may sound like me complaining but I actually see it as a badge of honor because when I make it to the lighthouse every week I know I took the hard road. In Destiny 2 I\u2019m excited to see how the new gameplay pans out and I plan to give all the classes a real good look this time. I\u2019ve had an amazing journey with the Hunter in the first run through Destiny so I figured I would dedicate some time to a new class. I know awhile back you were hoping to get an Icebreaker in your travels. Did you ever get one? Ohhh Icebreaker, the only exotic weapon that eluded me for many moons. Until the Weekly Elite Bounty blessed me with one on my second try, take that RNG! When it rains, it pours. When it rains, it pours. Now it seems I can\u2019t shake the Icebreaker. Aksis chest, Icebreaker, Lord Shaxx\u2019s weekly bounty, Icebreaker, random purple secondary engram, you guessed it, Icebreaker. I was trying to talk Pete into some sort of monthly Guardian to Guardian trade system. Imagine being awarded 9 Icebreaker but never having landed a Vision of Confluence. Wouldn\u2019t you like the ability to barter with another Guardian and swap weapons, I know I\u2019d love that feature. Pete gave me a hard NO, he said \"Yeah, but you\u2019d probably destroy the economy of the game.\" I\u2019m like, \"Yeah but then I\u2019d have all the weapons\u201d Spread the love around. Yeah, I\u2019d definitely spread the love. But, I understand we have to uphold the integrity of the game. You earn it, you rock it. Guess the trade system won\u2019t be happening any time soon. Do you play when you\u2019re out on the road doing shows in the ring? I prefer to play at home. When I\u2019m on the road, I\u2019m in full work mode. I\u2019ll talk about activities or different strats with some of the guys in the locker room but I\u2019m devoted to doing my job to the very best of my abilities and giving my fans my utmost attention. As soon as I get home and after spending time with my family I sit down in front of my giant screen, throw on my cans, drop the a/c to 65, close my blackout shades and sign in! At the ready is a gallon of water and a drawer full of controllers in the event I crush one after a bad beat. I literally immerse myself into Destiny. I got pages to complete in my Book. I got raids to run, Dailies and Weeklies to finish and hopefully I catch a day or two of Trials but understand, I miss a great deal of content while on the road but I will always get my Raids in. Awesome, thank you very much! The pleasure was all mine, thank you for allowing me to share. I\u2019d like to point out that he ended the interview with a crushing handshake. The man is a beast! We\u2019d like to take the time to thank both Big Show and WWE for making this interview happen, and we can\u2019t wait to see what he thinks about Destiny 2.

Spoiler Alert: We loved it.","body":"Hello, fellow Guardians! I\u2019ve had a week to recover from the Destiny 2 Reveal Event, which I sorely needed as it was quite an amazing experience. I was able to learn all sorts of new information about the game, see old friends, make some new ones, and play the game. In my last post, I talked about the new Strike and the PVP mode Countdown with my friends Colton and Mark. If you haven\u2019t seen our gameplay footage and thoughts, you can check it out here. But enough about those guys. In this post I\u2019m going to talk about the Homecoming mission from the campaign, part of which we got to play at the event.The mission began with a cinematic where Cayde-6, Ikora Rey, and Commander Zavala are trying to get to the bottom of a mysterious sensor anomaly\u2026 or rather a lack of sensor anomalies. It turns out that all of the sensors are offline, and during that moment of realization the Cabal brutally attack the Tower. The mission starts right after that and places you smack dab in the middle of the pure chaos. The attack has destroyed much of the Wall, and all around us frighteningly awesome, glowing orange Cabal drop-pods rain down from the sky. The design of these are extremely cool: they look nearly molten, almost like they\u2019ve come straight out of a volcano. Their walls \u2018dissolve\u2019 and out march the bad guys, intent on destroying everything in sight. As I eagerly fought off the waves of adds, I noticed a small change from the original game: your \u201cMission Objective\u201d now shows up in the HUD. In Destiny, you had to open your Ghost to see what that objective was, but now it\u2019s a nice on-screen reminder of your current goal. Another thing that really struck me right away was getting to fight alongside Zavala. It is extremely cool that the NPCs we know from the Tower are now actively involved in the battles. Not only is Zavala right there with you, but he also drops Orbs for you, which is extremely helpful for your brand-new Supers. During Bungie\u2019s opening keynote, we were introduced to the Titan\u2019s Sentinel, the Hunter\u2019s Arcstrider, and the Warlock\u2019s Dawnblade. In this campaign mission I played as a Warlock, which meant I got to rain flaming swords of death from above with the Dawnblade. It reminds me a bit of the Titan\u2019s Hammer of Sol, but with this new Super you remain floating in the sky like a fiery angel until it wears off. After repelling the Cabal waves, the next task was finding the Speaker. It was only as I ran towards the waypoint that I realized I had been fighting in the Tower courtyard this whole time. The action and destruction was so intense that I wasn\u2019t aware that the place where I was fighting was the social space where my fellow Guardians, Xur, the Postmaster, and Xander 99-40 usually are, only now it\u2019s been mostly reduced to rubble. However, there was no time to pause and reflect on what had been lost, humanity still needed saving! As I ran into the North Tower, I went past the Sweeper Bot, still sweeping away with his broom amidst the rubble and destruction. This little bot has become a huge fan-favorite and he got a massive cheer from the crowd during the keynote. Hopefully that\u2019s not the last we\u2019ll see of him. Next, we came across Ikora doing badass Warlock things as she obliterates a group of Cabal with a Nova Bomb. I\u2019m looking forward to the full campaign and getting to seeing more of Ikora when we visit her on Io, one of the new worlds in Destiny 2. After Ikora departed, the large doors where Xur used to hang out were blown open and we entered a section of the Tower that we never got to see in the original game. It also began to rain, and I want to point out that the atmospheric effects throughout the mission are really incredible, there\u2019s smoke, fire, rain and more, and those changes really make this feel like a living, breathing world. After battling through a marketplace, Amanda Holliday showed up and we were treated to another awesome cinematic. Once again, it\u2019s a reminder that the NPCs are fully integrated into the story. It really makes the world feel bigger and more unified. As we flew upwards to the Cabal command ship, the score swells and I was reminded of how great the music in Destiny was. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I bought the soundtrack. A score plays such an important part in creating epic moments, and it was great to experience even just a small part of it here. Anyhow, Amanda dropped us off on the Cabal ship, which has a similar design to that one that was crashed into the Dreadnaught. As I fought my way through, I noticed there is a new Cabal enemy with a gas tank on their back \u2014 hit that and you\u2019ll get a nice secondary explosion that can damage nearby enemies. Later in the mission there are some new sword-wielding Cabal as well. These guys will lunge and swipe at you, and they are fast and do some serious damage. So watch out. Following the waypoints led us to the shield generator, and it\u2019s there that we met Ghaul, the big bad leader of the Red Legion. He told us that our journey ended there, which was true for the moment as that is where the Homecoming mission came to a conclusion. Despite the fact that things look dire, I\u2019m sure we must get out of the situation somehow, but who knows if it will be unscathed. I\u2019m really looking forward to cracking into the full game in September, and hopefully getting to send the Red Legion back home... preferably in tiny pieces. Sometime this summer the Beta will drop and we\u2019ll get to play even more of the game alongside each other. Until then I\u2019m going to keep working on my Age of Triumph Record Book.

The game will launch worldwide on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, with additional, timed exclusive content available on the PS4. Also, Destiny 2 will be the first third-party game to be offered digitally via Battle.net, Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s online gaming service. One thing was very clear from the amount of detail revealed during the livestream: Destiny 2 is set to crank the Destiny experience meter to 11 and beyond. That means there\u2019s a lot to unpack here, so let\u2019s dive in CAMPAIGN The first gameplay reveal viewers were treated to was a look at Destiny 2\u2019s opening story mission from the campaign, which looks cinematic and inspiring. The scene opens on the initial level \u2018Homecoming\u2019 where your Guardian responds to an emergency in the Last Safe City, and to help set the stage, here\u2019s what you need to know going into the campaign: \u201cHumanity has fallen to an overwhelming invasion force, led by Lord Ghaul, the imposing commander of the brutal Red Legion. He has stripped Guardians of their power, and forced the survivors to flee their home. Players will venture out into our solar system to discover an arsenal of weapons and devastating new combat abilities. To defeat the Red Legion and confront Ghaul, they must reunite humanity\u2019s scattered heroes, stand together, and fight back to reclaim our home.\u201d That sounds both grim and exciting at the same time, and we can\u2019t wait to see more of the story as we try to defend mankind from annihilation. STRIKE Strikes are cooperative modes in Destiny optimized for a fireteam of three players as they battle their way through multiple enemies. Strikes will be returning in Destiny 2, and players at the gameplay reveal were treated to a look at one entitled \u201cThe Inverted Spire,\u201d which takes place on the new world of Nessus. The enemy Cabal have awoken something deep beneath the surface, and it\u2019s up to you and your follow Guardians to confront it. COMPETITIVE The PVP action in Destiny is home to some of the most intense battles across the cosmos, and Destiny 2 takes it to a whole new level as players engage in new 4v4 battles in The Crucible. At the gameplay reveal, teams engaged each other in an exciting new mode on a brand-new map: Countdown is a new competitive mode where players spawn on either Offense or Defense, and when the round ends you swap sides and roles. The goal is to plant a bomb at the enemy base, and then defend it until it explodes. Each round is worth one point. First team to six wins. To revive a teammate, you must use a revive token. Power weapon ammo is only granted to the one player who pulls it. Working as a team is the key to victory. Midtown is an abandoned part of the City. When the Red Legion invaded, they completely ignored this sector of the City in their takeover. The Legion deemed Midtown was of no tactical importance. Lord Shaxx agrees, which is why it was chosen as a Crucible arena in the first place. WORLDS Destiny 2 unfolds across the backdrop of familiar places, along with four stunning new worlds. European Dead Zone \u2013 The largest destination yet featuring a lush forest, abandoned town, a cave system below the surface, and a Red Legion military base to explore and contest. Titan \u2013 One of Saturn\u2019s Moons where Commander Zavala is regrouping at the hands of Ghaul. There is no land on Titan. Instead, players explore a series of Golden Age platforms surrounded by a rolling ocean. Nessus \u2013 a strange and unstable planetoid that has been fully consumed by the Vex where players will find Cayde-6 is caught up in his own adventures in a stunning landscape of sheer walls, lush canyons, and creepy Vex caverns. Io \u2013 A moon of Jupiter, where Ikora Rey has gone in search of answers. Io is the last known site the Traveler visited during the Golden Age, it\u2019s now occupied by our enemies. FEATURES Along with the gripping new campaign and additional worlds to explore comes new and returning features, including: New Director Your guide throughout Destiny 2 in your search for Adventures, Lost Sectors, new Public Events, and more. Players can pick a landing zone, explore, and seamlessly jump into other activities in game. Adventures Shorter missions with self-contained stories for players to learn more about the Destiny 2 universe and the characters that live there. Lost Sectors Scattered, enemy dungeon layers throughout the world you can discover with unique boss enemies guarding treasure to earn. Public Events Unique, optional, dynamic combat activities that players can join on the fly as they roam around the world solo or with other players. Guided Games A new feature that brings solo players and clan communities together to play Destiny 2\u2019s most challenging activities including Raids, Trials and Nightfall Strikes.

Face-off Against Opponents in Competitive Experiences The Crucible: Competitive 4v4 PvP Gameplay with New Modes and Maps LOOT And last but not least, as Cayde-6 said so eloquently in the worldwide reveal trailer, \u201cThere will be a ton of loot!\u201d So, prepare to deck out your Guardian in plenty of new gear and equip them with a plethora of exotic weaponry.

The fiercely difficult track, notorious for inciting a generation of nimble-fingered GH experts, has just been added back into Guitar Hero Live via this week\u2019s Shred-A-Thon. Shred-A-Thon is a 5-day marathon of the top five toughest songs in Guitar Hero Live, on repeat. It is, in essence, the official playground for fans looking to be the very first to tackle the return of DragonForce. This time there\u2019s a new layer of complexity to the song with Guitar Hero Live\u2019s six-button guitar controller layout, a true equalizer for both newcomers and even the most advanced players. We spoke with FreeStyleGames Senior Designer Nathan Coppard and Senior MIDI Designer Charles Withall to talk about the return of \u201cThrough the Fire and Flames,\u201d the note-tracking process of such a difficult track, and the other toughest songs in this week\u2019s Shred-A-Thon. Why do you think Through the Fire and Flames is such a fan favorite? Nathan Coppard: \u201cThrough the Fire and Flames\u201d (TTFAF) is essentially the final boss of Guitar Hero games. Back in the day, you had to beat all of Guitar Hero 3 just to unlock it. Now, 9 years later, it still represents the ultimate test of Guitar Hero mastery. The song is also really fun to play, which is vital in helping to offset the face melting difficulty. Featuring epic power metal riffs, relentless speed and back to back guitar solos, mastering TTFAF is a hugely satisfying challenge that pushes Guitar Hero gameplay to the absolute limit. As one of the hardest songs in the history of Guitar Hero, I have to imagine it\u2019s even harder to note-track and program\u2014how did the team go about bringing it to Guitar Hero Live? Charles Withall: Note-tracking an already notorious track like DragonForce was a big challenge but also a really exciting opportunity to bring the nightmarish difficulty it posed in GH3 to the new button layout of Guitar Hero Live. More than any other track we thought it was important to consider the note chart from GH3, but simultaneously, the new 3x2 button layout provided us with a new approach to the gameplay. For example, in the intro section, the six buttons and the open strums allow for a more pitch-accurate representation of the melody while providing the additional difficulty of maintaining the stamina in your strumming arm. The sweeping runs in the solo sections also take advantage of the inclusion of the sixth button. Guitar Hero Live: Shred-A-Thon Are you ready to go through the fire and flames? This is \u201cShred-A-Thon,\u201d the ultimate test of Guitar Hero skills\u2026Ready to win big? Post a pic of your highest score from any \u201cShred-A-thon\u201d track in the comments, and you can win a golden guitar controller, player cards, song plays, and more! Head here for details: Guitarhero.com/GHShredAThonSweeps (US ONLY). Good luck, rockers \u2014 you\u2019re gonna need it\u2026 Posted by Guitar Hero on Wednesday, February 3, 2016 As soon as the first pass of Expert difficulty was completed, the design team began a fiercely competitive leader board of high scores. That process in itself led to lots of detailed changes and suggestions from the team as a whole. It\u2019s a testament to how exciting it was for us to work with this song, because everyone wanted to get involved! Getting the difficulty reductions right was one of the hardest parts of designing the chart. We wanted players who would usually play on casual, regular, or advanced to be able to play on their usual difficulty level but still appreciate the nails hard challenge that Expert players were getting. At regular difficulty for example, the frequency and speed you\u2019re asked to play at is way more demanding than any other track at regular, but the core elements of what we believe makes regular difficulty are present; the chord shapes are limited to barre and split chords while, on the most part, the melodies avoid jumping from row to row in the middle of phrases. Ultimately, our aim was to make the track as challenging as we could, and to really push the 3x2 button layout to the limit. All of us in the markup team are really happy with how it turned out, and we feel honored to have worked on such a legendary Guitar Hero song. Needless to say, \u201cThrough the Fire and Flames\u201d is still the hardest song to conquer in GH Live. What kind of new challenges will fans face in \u201cThrough the Fire and the Flames\u201d in Guitar Hero Live? Nathan Coppard: GHTV feels like the perfect home for TTAF. We\u2019ve turned on Rival Challenges for every song in the Shred-a-Thon so you\u2019ll be competing head to head with other players. Not only do you have to beat the track but now you have to beat your rivals too. We\u2019re hoping to see some cool tactics emerging with high level, competitive use of Hero Powers. If you\u2019re struggling to work your way up the leader boards, don\u2019t forget to upgrade your guitar to unlock its full scoring potential. Playing TTFAF on the six-button Guitar Hero Live controller gives players a new way to experience this classic track. The new guitar allows us to really push the difficulty level, mastering it is going to require some serious skill. In addition to DragonForce, this week\u2019s programming includes some of the hardest tracks in Guitar Hero Live. How were those tracks identified? Nathan Coppard: Alongside DragonForce, the Shred-a-Thon includes tracks from Megadeth, Trivium, Lamb of God and Alter Bridge. Each track represents a different area of skill for players to try and master. Hangar 18\u2019s classic riffs and complex solo rhythms are followed by a test of precision timing and speed required to play Strife. Next up is the technical rhythmic complexity of Ghost Walking and the epic endurance marathon that is Cry of Achilles. Don\u2019t miss your chance to put your Guitar Hero Live skills to the test during this week\u2019s Shred-a-Thon, which lasts until Monday, February 8, at 7:00am PT.
